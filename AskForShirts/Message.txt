Dear [CollegeName] Admissions,

I just finished my senior year of highschool, and I am extremely interested in attending this college.
It would mean the world to me you could send me a shirt so I could represent your university.
Could you please send to 

{Kenneth Cullen}
{989 Canyon Ridge Rd, Apt 101}

Thank you,
{Kenneth}
